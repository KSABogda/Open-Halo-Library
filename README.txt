Open Halo Library
Copyright (C) 2017 Andrew Burnett

An open library for parsing, decompiling, and editing Halo: Combat Evolved maps.

To compile, you'll need the BOOST library.
Use the compile flags: -lboost_filesystem -lboost_system

WEEK THREE PROGRESS REPORT:

Basic cache file (.map) parsing is complete. Still need to
read and use the raw data sections of the file. This cannot be
done until parsing of certain tag files themselves is completed.

As of now, the cache class objects can only be created when given a
file path to a Halo map file. From there, you can get the tag count,
and use the extract_tag(index, path) function to extract tags.

The testing main in cache.cpp uses the extract_tag function to extract all
tags in a map and places them in a new folder "tags/."

The tags folder becomes nearly identical to what the original Halo
developers must have saw.

TO DO:

Add parsing of certain tag classes, work with raw data.
